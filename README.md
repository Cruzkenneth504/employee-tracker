# Employee Tracker

## Description 

I created this project employee tracker to easily store and manage employee data, such as roles, departments and other relevant information. It is essential for businesses to have an accurate and up-to-date record of their employees to ensure the smooth functioning of their operations. This project provides an easy-to-use system for tracking employee information and for ensuring that your business and employees are in compliance with relevant regulations. With this you will have comprehensive records of each employee, from hire date to job role and salary details. Furthermore, it allows for quick searches and exports of employee information, making data access hassle-free.
